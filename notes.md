# Notes

## AWS Web Server
- **Creating the server instance:** Change location to us-east-1, use AMI ID ami-0b009f6c56cdd83ed, make sure that all traffic is allowed
- **SSH into the server:** ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address], use cd to change directories, ls -l to list files, exit to stop
- **Elastic IP:** Allocate an elastic IP to keep the same IP after server restart
- **My server:** Elastic IP: 34.232.209.210, web address: http://34.232.209.210
